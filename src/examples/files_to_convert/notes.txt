1. We only parse functions, all code outside the functions should be ignored.
2. We remove `let` and `var` from expressions.
3. We parse the main function to turn it into the body of GenExpr
    1. We first should find all arguments that have defaul values
        and turn them into `Param varName(defaultValue)`
    2. All other arguments we should enumerate as
        in1, in2, etc and assign them to the correspondent variables.
    3. Return statement:
        - If the main function returns the value, it can be compiled into `out = return_expression`
        - If we return values inside `[]`, we should asign every expression in the `[]` as `outN = expression`
